            <h2>Software Developer, and Artist!</h2>
            <p>Hi, my dream is to become a Software Developer! I enrolled in FullStack Academy in order to make that dream a possibility. It's challenging, but I know I can make it through. Join me along this ride!</p><br />
            <p>"All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by the night in the dusty recesses of their minds awake to find that it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible." - T.E. Lawrence, Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triump.</p><br />
